# Security Policy

We use GitHub's bots to stay informed on easy-to-detect vulnerabilities,
however, these bots will likely not detect issues with some of the
infrastructure we use in `rules_ll`.

We will put a high emphasis on fixing any vulnerabilities, so please
don't hesitate to send us a report if you think something is not right.

## Supported Versions

Since the repositories exposed by `rules_ll` will usually be  very close
to upstream, the only supported version is always the latest prerelease.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private security advisory to report vulnerabilities.

If a vulnerability does not lie with rules_ll itself but with one of the
dependencies we integrate, please let us know anyways, so that we can
bump the vulnerable dependency.
